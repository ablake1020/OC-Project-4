Fixes for SEO

- Added <title> tag in the html <head> to describe the page
- Correctly named the Contact page
- Removed the keyword chain above and under the GoMikeDesigns logo
- There were several images conveying text. I removed the images and typed out the text in the HTML
- Organized headings based on best practices. The structure follows as one h1, several h2s and several h3 elements.
- The images had either no alt tags or keyword-spammed alt tags in the HTML. I fixed that to describe what the page is about.
- The footer pages were crammed with fake links and unneccesary infomation. I stored the social media links in the footer, as there is a dedicated contact page.
- Used semantic tags for my HTML code structure

Fixes for Accessibility
- Increased the text-to-background contrast to at least 4.5:1 or 3:1 standards.
- <p> element text size was increased for better visibility and the decreased need for some users to zoom in.
- 

Fixes for Performance
- I removed unused CSS from the four styling files to decrease file sizes.
- All JavaScript files have been minified to reduce file size.
- Images were converted from BMP files to JPG files, then compressed, saving up to 80% of the file size.
- Unused images were deleted from the img folder in the code files.
